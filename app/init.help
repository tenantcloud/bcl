PROJECT  - The full name of the project you wish to create.
           Example: new_project

This will create a project structure for new Bash CLI projects
we're creating. It will create the <project> directory, with
the app/ directory inside it. The app directory will contain
the .bash_cli file and a default .author file (default author
name is the `whoami` command output).
